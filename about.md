Business Analytics is rapidly rising up the priority ladder for small and medium business managers around the world. Larger businesses had walked down this path and are more mature and clear about their expectations from use of business intelligence and data analytics. However while many small and medium businesses are exploring the possibilities of what analytics can provide, they are far too often overwhelmed with too many options: data platforms, analysis tools, deployment choices and the type of analytics would best meet their immediate objectives. Some business owners tend to be more ambitiouis and attempt to build their own data science teams - which is actually quite a challenge - especially if you are a small business.

 

Small and Medium businesses that harbour data analytics ambitions typically can be put in two buckets: ones which have a well articulated problem that can be addressed by analytics and others which only conceptually understand the value of analytics. The first bucket - where the problem is well-defined - is much more mature when it comes to analytics implementation. The second bucket companies need to start small, imbibe and ramp up.

 

This is where the challenge comes in as there are no such ramps in the marketplace. Companies have to go the whole hog: software, consulting, and maybe even staffing.  

 

We adopt the global best practice broadly along the lines of Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) to determine how to start incorporating analytics into any business. The first two steps are business understanding and data understanding. One of the concerns small business owners have about analytics is the lack of complete clarity on how it would impact their business. The methodology remedies this by identifying potential business problems with the highest organizational value and the highest level of data maturity for analytic implementation.

 

The goal of this process is to develop a complete data strategy.  Data Strategy starts with your strategic business objectives and views them together with an analysis of workflows, data requirements, and technical capabilities.  The result is a custom development roadmap for your company, focused on achieved near-term benefits and creating a platform for future innovation.
