Title : Leverage maps for rapid exploratory data analysis
---





A lesson every data analyst knows by heart is that visualizing the data before diving into analysis always pays. 

 

If there is a geographical dimention to the underlying dataset, it always helps to visualize it using geographical maps. By integrating with geo-location data and putting on maps, datasets throw immediate insights that were unseen before. Working with maps makes the investigation more attractive and engaging and stimulates the analyst's mind to bring new insights which were previously hidden. 

 

To begin generating insights, it is not necessary to have a comprehensive mapping. We always insist that our analysts begin with simplest analysis possible: just put all the data on map and try out various filters and color mapping. Give opportunity to the data to speak to them and guide their analysis.

 

The quick analysis typically follows segmenting and filtering of data, isolating areas of interest and comparing them with either the whole or with other isolated areas. The data can then be put into perspective of other relevant datasets such as demographic data. 

 

Often, visual review of the data untangles complex relationships and sometimes game changing insights very early on in analysis.  

 

Once an initial visual survey is done, then one would progress to do more sophisticated analysis: heat maps, bubble maps, territory maps etc.  Data would be segmented as per the problem definition: for example geographically plot sales (margins) of all customers by using a filtering tool to isolate sales (margins) above or below a certain level.  A layer can then be added to filter similar data from previous year or for a different product line. This way one can have visual representation of sales (margins) performance over two years or two product lines. And this is just a beginning. 

 

The insights thus generated gives directions to deeper analysis and focus on what is important.
